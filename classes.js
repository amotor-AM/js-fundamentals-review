/* 
We have a school to build here! In this project you will get used to thinking about classes in JavaScript and building them from a brand new data set.
*/

/* 
Pokemon
 - First we need a Pokemon class. This will be our base-class
 - Pokemon receives name, height, weight, level as props
 - Every Pokemon should also be initialized with a health attribute set to 50
 - Pokemon receives sleep as a method.
    - This method will return the pokemon's health to 100
- Pokemon receives levelUp as a method.
    - This method should increase the pokemon's level by 1

FireType
 - Now that we have a Pokemon as our base class, we'll build our FireType class.
 - FireType uses the same attributes that have been set up by Pokemon
 - FireType has the following unique props:
     - type property set to 'fire'
     - nickname property
     - weaknesses property initialized to an array with the values 'water', 'ground', 'rock'
 - FireType has the following methods:
     - fireAttack which should return the string `${name} just blew a giant fireball.'
*/

class Pokemon {
  constructor(props) {
    this.name = props.name;
    this.height = props.height;
    this.weight = props.weight;
    this.level = props.level;
    this.health = 50;
  }
  sleep() {
    this.health = 100;
  }
  levelUp() {
    this.level++;
  }
}

class FireType extends Pokemon() {
  constructor(fireAttrs) {
    super(fireAttrs);
    this.property = "fire";
    this.nickname = fireAttrs.nickname;
    this.weakness = ["water", "ground", "rock"];
  }
  fireAttack() {
    return `${this.name} just blew a giant fireball`;
  }
}

/* Uncomment below to test your code */

const charmander = new FireType({
  name: "Charmander",
  height: "23in",
  weight: "18lbs",
  level: 7,
});

console.log(charmander.fireAttack()); // Hello my name is Severus charmander, I am from Hogwarts
console.log(charmander.health); // 50
console.log(charmander.level); // 7
console.log(charmander.sleep());
console.log(charmander.health); // 100
console.log(charmander.weaknesses); // ['water', 'ground', 'rock']
